# Ubuntu-Inspired Image Fetcher

> *The Wisdom of Ubuntu: "I am because we are."*  

This project is a Python script that demonstrates how **community, respect, sharing, and practicality** can be reflected in code.  
It fetches images from the internet, saves them in an organized directory, and logs each download for later appreciation.

##  Features

- **Community**: Connects to the global web to fetch shared resources.  
- **Respect**: Handles errors gracefully without crashing.  
- **Sharing**: Saves all images in a central `Fetched_Images` directory for later use.  
- **Practicality**: Maintains a `download_log.txt` file with timestamps and source URLs.
